That said, according to <a href=\"/wiki/Klaus_Krippendorff\" title=\"Klaus Krippendorff\">Klaus Krippendorff</a>, six questions must be addressed in every content analysis:<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Krippendorff2004_5-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Krippendorff2004-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n",
            "</p>, <p>The simplest and most objective form of content analysis considers unambiguous characteristics of the text such as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Word_frequencies\" title=\"Word frequencies\">word frequencies</a>, the page area taken by a newspaper column, or the duration of a <a href=\"/wiki/Radio\" title=\"Radio\">radio</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Television\" title=\"Television\">television</a> program. Analysis of simple word frequencies is limited because the meaning of a word depends on surrounding text.  <a href=\"/wiki/Key_Word_in_Context\" title=\"Key Word in Context\">Key Word In Context</a> (KWIC) routines address this by placing words in their textual context.

Steam is the largest online game retailer, so using their data makes sense for generalization and getting maximal data (so my assumptions can be weaker, in accordance with the readings/lecture). However, Epic Games is another online game retailer with more systematic and clear-cut free price promotions, making it a great alternative to Steam data if need be. In fact, forming a theory based on the Steam data and checking its robustness with the Epic Games market would help with scaling up. Fortunately, Steam data is well-reported, so I don't have to worry about bias there, but free price promotion reporting on Reddit could be biased to popular games, so I'll have to be careful there."
